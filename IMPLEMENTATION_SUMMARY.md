## 🗄️ Database Changes

### Migration Required
```sql
-- Add email tracking columns to payments table
ALTER TABLE payments 
ADD COLUMN email_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN email_sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL,
ADD COLUMN email_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_email_sent ON payments(email_sent, created_at);
```

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

### Required for Production
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
REPLY_TO_EMAIL=support@yourdomain.com
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Development Testing
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev  # For testing only
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps
